# TestStubs
Provides simple stub handling for test cases

## Installation
Add the selby satis repo to your composer.json
```json
{
    "repositories": [
            {
                "type": "composer",
                "url": "https://satis.selby.as"
            }
        ]
}
```

Install the package
```shell script
composer require knutle/test-stubs
```

## Usage
See tests.

## Testing
Run test suite
```bash
composer test
```

Run test suite and update snapshots
```bash
composer test:snap
```

## Deployment 
Whenever a version tag is pushed, and all tests pass, a new release with an auto-generated changelog will be created from the latest version tag.

**Version tags need to be fully qualified, (for example v1.1 will be rejected, but v1.1.0 is OK)**

You should ensure that all required PHP extensions are initialized in the workflow. Run `composer check-platform-reqs` to get a list of all required extensions, then add them to the correct step in the workflow definition.

### Changelog
The changelog is generated by listing all the commits since last deploy.
